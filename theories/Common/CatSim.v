(** * Common.CatSim — reusable star-semantics infrastructure for binaries
      that perform a sequence of write(fd=1) syscalls before a terminating
      exit/exit_group syscall (e.g. cat-argv).

    TRUST BOUNDARY: image-INDEPENDENT proof library (like Common.ExitSim),
    built over the star-based [LinuxProcessSem.Run] trace semantics.  Generic over
    the loaded segments [segs].  The per-binary proof supplies, for each
    binary, an inductive [to_wexit ms0 bufs code] derivation (built by
    symbolic execution over the argv layout — see [Common.PropExec] step
    lemmas) with a SHARED [bufs] and [code], and glues the two together via
    [cat_strong_equiv_te].

    Syscall numbers, channel ids, and exit codes are [word = bv 64];
    buffers are [list byte] with [byte = bv 8].  Following the ExitSim
    conventions:

    - the write-syscall number test is Z-characterized: [tw_write] (and the
      [write1_*]/[sstep_write_inv] lemmas) carry a pending number [x8] with
      [bv_unsigned x8 = 64%Z] (mirroring [is_exit_no]; avoids pinning a
      particular [bv] literal spelling);
    - fd/channel 1 is spelled [Z_to_bv 64 1] (the [init_model] spelling);
    - [N.land code 255] is spelled [bv_and code (Z_to_bv 64 255)].

    An "exit-after-writes" binary runs a finite deterministic straight line of
    machine instructions punctuated by write(1, buf, len) syscalls, then an
    exit.  A channel write to fd 1 leaves the model untouched, but the
    ENVIRONMENT chooses how much of the buffer is delivered: any NONEMPTY
    prefix [firstn n buf] (1 <= n <= length buf) is admissible, returning the
    delivered length and emitting one [WriteEv 1 b] per delivered byte.  The
    machine side is still deterministic, so we capture a binary with an
    inductive [to_wexit] whose write node is RET-OBLIVIOUS: the continuation
    must handle every delivered length n.  The set of complete traces is then
    the per-buffer prefix choices [wpick]:

    - [obs_trace] of the run is exactly the prefixes of
      [full ++ [ExitEv code fs0]] for the [full] with [wpick 1 bufs full]
      (cat_obs_iff_te), and
    - the run can NEVER take the explicit error transition
      ([~ reaches_error]; cat_no_error_run_te).

    Combined into [Equivalence.equiv] via [cat_strong_equiv_te]: two
    exit-after-writes binaries that emit the same buffers and exit code are
    observably equivalent (neither errors) — both denote the same set of
    delivery choices. *)
