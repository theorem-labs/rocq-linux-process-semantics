(** * Common.StreamSim — reusable star-semantics infrastructure for binaries
      that loop { n = read(0, buf, cnt); if n <= 0 exit(0); write(1, buf, n) }
      with a single cnt-byte buffer (streamcat).

    TRUST BOUNDARY: image-INDEPENDENT proof library, written against the
    star-based [LinuxProcessSem.Run] trace semantics.

    Channel ids, counts and exit codes are [word = bv 64]; blocks are
    [list byte] with [byte = bv 8].  Following the ExitSim/CatSim
    conventions:

    - the read-syscall number test is Z-characterized: the pending number
      [x8] satisfies [bv_unsigned x8 = 63%Z] (mirroring CatSim's
      [tw_write]; avoids pinning a particular [bv] literal spelling), and
      [ReadPend]/[WrPend] carry that [x8] existentially;
    - fd/channel 0 and 1 are spelled [Z_to_bv 64 0] / [Z_to_bv 64 1]
      (the [init_model] spelling);
    - the chunk size is [cnt : word] with the hypothesis
      [(0 < bv_unsigned cnt)%Z]; block-length bounds are [Z] comparisons
      over [Z.of_nat (length bs)] and [bv_unsigned cnt];
    - block clauses are typed away by [byte = bv 8] ([block_ok] is
      2 conjuncts).

    Under the current model a channel read on fd 0 (count cnt > 0, channel
    not yet at EOF, destination buffer writable-mapped) has EXACTLY these
    admissible outcomes:

    - EOF-now: ret 0, no writes, no events; EOF becomes STICKY in the model,
      so the program's n<=0 exit path is LIVE and ends the trace with
      [ExitEv 0 fs0];
    - any 1..cnt bytes [bs] of the environment's choosing, written into the
      buffer and recorded one byte-carrying [ReadEv 0 b] per byte.  Short
      reads are real.

    A single channel write to fd 1 delivers a nonempty prefix of the
    environment's choosing — one [WriteEv 1 b] per delivered byte — and
    leaves the model untouched.  The binaries therefore echo each block
    through a put-style RETRY loop (WallSim's [to_wall] node): however
    the deliveries chunk, they concatenate to exactly the block, so each
    iteration contributes the [ReadEv]s of its block followed by ALL of
    its [WriteEv]s.  Hence the observable trace set of a streamcat-shaped
    binary is exactly [stream_traces cnt fs0]: the prefixes of

        flat_map iter_ev blocks ++ [ExitEv 0 fs0]

    over all lists of admissible blocks (a prefix of the never-EOF
    infinite run lies within finitely many blocks, so this form also
    covers non-terminating resolutions).

    The per-binary proof supplies a loop-head predicate [LH] and a proof
    that every [LH] state runs (deterministically) to a read-pending ecall
    state ([to_rd]) whose EOF continuation reaches an exit(0) ecall and
    whose every-bytes continuation reaches the echo write-pending state
    with a write-all derivation ([WallSim.to_wall]) of the whole block
    down to an [LH] state.  This file turns that single per-iteration
    fact into the full trace characterization ([stream_obs_iff]), the
    no-error fact, and the pair equivalence ([stream_strong_equiv]). *)
