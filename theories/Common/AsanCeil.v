(** * Common.AsanCeil — the reflective ASan plan checker's CONSTANT allocation
      ceiling and floor, bridged to the run-dependent spec.

    The reflective ASan automation (AsanPlanCore / AsanPlan / AsanPlanSound /
    the AsanNodes* files) assumes that every anonymous grant ends below the
    CONSTANT [alloc_ceiling = 0x7fff7f800000] and that first-fit placement
    starts at [bottomup_floor = 0x2aaaaaaab000].  The spec instead bounds
    grants by [State.alloc_top h = vm_init_sp h - stack_max_size] (the RUN's
    stack pointer) and has no floor (placement is admissibility, not a
    search).  The checker keeps its numeric constants
    ([AsanPlanCore.CEIL] / [FLOOR]); soundness needs only that the constant
    ceiling lies at or below the spec's: for every admissible run
    [sp >= sp_window_lo = 0x7fff80000000] ([Run.valid_sp]), hence
    [alloc_top h = sp - 8 MiB >= 0x7fff7f800000 = alloc_ceiling], exactly, and the
    stack pointer field of the ledger never changes after [init_model].

    [init_sp_ok h] is the invariant the node soundness proofs carry (it is a
    conjunct of [BackingAlgebra.model_ivs_wf]); [alloc_ceiling_le_alloc_top]
    turns a [<= alloc_ceiling] side condition into the spec's [<= alloc_top h].
    [hint_placement_ok_b] is the first-fit placement gate that the checker's
    boolean grant tests use.  SINCE OSSV-231 THE SPEC HAS SUCH A GATE:
    [Sys/Mm/Mmap.linux_place] names the ONE address Linux gives, so the
    gate is a THEOREM ([placement_policy_holds]) rather than a named
    hypothesis the node layer carries. *)

(** ** The placement gate, stated over [Sys/Mm/Mmap.linux_place]

    WHAT THE GATE SAYS NOW.  [placement_ok h aZ nZ] is "aZ is where
    Linux puts a NULL-hint anonymous request of nZ bytes into the
    ledger h, on one of the two kernel builds" — the spec's own
    [Mmap.linux_place] at hint 0, with the build existentially
    quantified because the ASan plan layer does not carry the run's
    [State.KernelBuild].  [placement_ok_b] decides it with
    [Checks.Placement.linux_place_b], and [placement_ok_window] reads
    off Linux's two search windows (mm/mmap.c,
    [generic_get_unmapped_area_topdown], Linux v6.18.46 commit
    1f99e9ab748f): the grant either ends inside
    [[page_size, mmap_top h)] or starts at or above
    [task_unmapped_base].  The ASan lower bound
    ([AsanPlacement.null_hint_grant_above]) needs more than that
    summary: it uses the MAXIMALITY of the top-down branch, which only
    the full predicate carries, which is why the gate keeps the
    predicate.

    WHAT IT SAID BEFORE, AND WHY THAT WAS NOT A THEOREM.  The old gate
    was "at or above [bottomup_floor], or no free gap is higher below
    [vm_mmap_base h]" — the postcondition of a FIRST-FIT search the
    spec did not have — and the old [placement_policy] derived it from
    the four conditions of the old [choose] guard.  Both halves of
    that hypothesis are false, before and after this change:

    (i) its address was quantified over EVERY free page-aligned range
        below [alloc_top h], and Linux picks one of them.  With an
        empty ledger and [nZ = page_size], [aZ = page_size] passes the
        four old guard conditions and fails the old gate: it is not at
        or above the floor, and gaps above it are free.  So the
        premise has to name Linux's address, which is what
        [linux_place] does.

    (ii) even at Linux's address the old conclusion
        [aZ + nZ <= alloc_ceiling] is false for some admissible runs.
        The top-down window's ceiling is
        [mmap_top h = Z.min (vm_mmap_base h) (page_round_down_Z (alloc_top h))],
        and [Run.valid_mmap_base] allows [vm_mmap_base h] up to
        [State.mmap_base_max = 0x7ffff8000000], which is ABOVE the
        constant [alloc_ceiling = 0x7fff7f800000]; [alloc_top h] is as
        high as [sp_window_hi - stack_max_size = 0x7fffff800000].  A
        grant in [[alloc_ceiling, alloc_top h)] is Linux's and breaks
        the bound.  (This is residual R-a of the OSSV-231 plan.)  The
        true bound at Linux's address is [aZ + nZ <= alloc_top h],
        which [Placement.linux_place_admissible] gives, so the grant
        predicates state that one and the gate states none. *)
