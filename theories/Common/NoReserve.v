(** * Common.NoReserve — the MAP_NORESERVE mmap node, lazy-tolerant
      syscall nodes, and the chained disjoint straight line

    TRUST BOUNDARY: image-INDEPENDENT proof library, like [ShapeAlg] /
    [SpinAlg] (which this file extends) and [LazyFrame] / [DivergeSim]
    (whose machinery it consumes).  Nothing here is part of the trusted
    specification.

    This file closes the three residuals [SpinAlg]'s header enumerates —
    the last proof-infrastructure tier before a full ASan equivalence
    skeleton is writable with node applications only:

    RESIDUAL 1 — THE NORESERVE-SHAPED MMAP NODE.  [mmap_args_ok] pins
    flags = MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS (34), so ASan's shadow reservation
    (34 | 0x4000 = MAP_NORESERVE, i.e. 16418) had no node.
    [mmap_args_ok_noreserve] pins the NORESERVE spelling of the same
    modeled shape ([Mmap.mmap_flags_core] masks exactly that bit before
    the shape match, Mmap.v:335-336/796-799), and the node family
    ([node_mmap_noreserve], [srz_mmap_noreserve], [srz_mmap_spin_noreserve],
    with the inversion [sstep_mmap_inv_noreserve]) mirrors [SpinAlg]'s,
    with two deliberate differences:
      - the grant successor wraps the model with [vm_add_lazy] (the
        [with_mmap_backing] path, Mmap.v:341-342/944): [mmap_model_noreserve]
        = [vm_add_lazy a n (mmap_model a n model)], so after a grant
        [m_vm_lazy] is NON-EMPTY (State.v:2307-2317 — the interior of a
        page-aligned, page-rounded nonzero grant is the singleton
        [(a, n)]);
      - the grant condition [grant_ok_nr] has NO budget conjunct: the
        reservation is granted regardless of remaining backed budget
        ([mmap_noreserve_backed_ok], Mmap.v:873-876, unconditionally
        [true] for a NORESERVE call — pages charge on first touch inside
        [mi_account_step], Run.v:277-287).
    The refusal arm is RETAINED (failure-anytime stays, by ruling): the
    plain node keeps both arms, and the spin-armed node discharges each
    refusal by [DivergeSim.to_spin] exactly as [SpinAlg.srz_mmap_spin].

    RESIDUAL 2 — LAZY-TOLERANT SYSCALL NODES.  After a NORESERVE grant,
    every [m_vm_lazy model = []] premise is dead for the rest of the run
    on the grant path.  The nodes the ASan skeleton needs are re-derived
    without it:
      - mmap / munmap / exit have EMPTY effect access lists
        ([State.syscall_effect_accesses]: no [eff_writes], no
        [eff_copyins]), so [DivergeSim.materialize_model_accesses_nil]
        replaces [materialize_model_accesses_no_lazy] and the premise
        just DROPS: [node_mmap_lazy] / [srz_mmap_lazy] /
        [srz_mmap_spin_lazy], [node_munmap_lazy] / [srz_munmap_lazy]
        (with inversions [sstep_mmap_inv_lazy] / [sstep_munmap_inv_lazy]).
        [SpinAlg.srz_exit] never had the premise — exit needs nothing.
      - write(1, buf, n) is the one node whose effect DOES carry an
        access ([eff_copyins = [(buf, n)]] — the syscall READS user
        memory, and a read materializes lazy pages like any access), so
        its lazy-tolerant form takes the [LazyFrame] DISJOINTNESS
        hypothesis instead — the buffer lies outside every lazy range
        ([node_write1_disjoint] / [srz_write1_disjoint], inversions
        [sstep_write_next_inv_disjoint] / [sstep_write_inv_disjoint]).
        In an ASan binary that hypothesis is real and discharged by the
        placement gate: the buffer lives in the binary's data/stack
        segments, and [grant_ok]/[grant_ok_nr]'s [region_free] keeps
        every reservation disjoint from the image.

    RESIDUAL 3 — THE CHAINED DISJOINT STRAIGHT LINE.  [msteps_acc], the
    [msteps] analog that CARRIES the per-step access reports, with
    [srz_msteps_disjoint] / [rz_msteps_disjoint] / [ts_msteps_disjoint]:
    a straight line of instructions whose accumulated report is disjoint
    from every lazy range walks any [srealizes]/[realizes]/[to_spin]
    obligation through a non-empty ledger.  The per-instruction
    [stepacc_*] lemmas mirror [PropExec]'s step inventory at the
    [step_accesses] level (same hypotheses, conclusion carries the access
    report): the generic ALU/branch/jump/ecall forms report [] and the
    seven load forms report their single read range.  PropExec has no
    store lemmas, so none are mirrored here (same scope, one level down).

    The worked example [AsanInitReal] at the bottom is the full ASan-init
    shape in miniature: a NORESERVE reservation (refusal spins; grant
    makes the ledger non-empty), a plain rw mmap THROUGH the non-empty
    ledger (refusal spins; grant continues), a write(1) of a
    ledger-disjoint buffer, and an exit — concluding the standard
    obs_iff / no_error pair with a proof that is node applications and
    leaves only. *)
