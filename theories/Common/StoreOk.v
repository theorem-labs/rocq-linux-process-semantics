(** * StoreOk — discharging the machine-store bound

    [RiscvSemantics.store_ok segs m a n] is the premise every machine
    store carries: each of the [n] bytes from [a] must be writable
    in [wview], the overlay merged over the 'w' segments.  It is the
    same view the syscall specs write through, and the SIGSEGV
    analogue when it fails (see the comment at [store_ok] itself for
    why an unbounded store made [strong_universal] falsifiable).

    Proofs never unfold it.  Every store site in the examples is one of
    three shapes, and this file turns each into a one-line side
    condition:

    - the STACK: an address in the RLIMIT_STACK window
      [[Run.stack_window_lo], init_sp) that [Run.init_machine_state]
      (and its proof-side mirror [PropExec.wrap_mem]) zero-maps up
      front — [store_ok_wrap_window];
    - a HEAP grant: an address inside a range some brk/mmap already
      zero-filled — [store_ok_zeros_hit], or [store_ok_zmem] for the
      single-grant spelling the examples actually carry;
    - .data/.bss: an address in a WRITABLE segment, where [wview] falls
      through to the segment image whatever the overlay holds.  The
      per-byte condition is decidable, and is exactly [StreamSim.wseg_ok],
      so an image settles its whole rw- window once by [vm_compute] and
      every store inside it costs two [lia]s — [store_ok_window].

    On top of that: anywhere the proof has ALREADY stored, or that a
    syscall wrote, the overlay only grows, so an earlier [store_ok]
    still holds — [store_ok_mono] and the [mem_grows] instances below.

    The monotonicity story is what keeps store proofs cheap: a store site
    deep in a long [wbytes]/[apply_zeros] chain proves its bound
    against the ORIGINAL memory and lifts it through the chain, instead
    of re-deriving it against a term that grows with every step.  It is
    also what a loop invariant carries when its memory is quantified
    existentially and there is no [wrap_mem] left to peel back to: the
    invariant says [mem_grows wmem mem] and registers the projection in
    [store_ok_db], which is where [solve_store_ok_inv] looks. *)

(** ** [store_ok] discharges a read BUFFER's writability too

    [read(2)] into a buffer raises the obligation

      read_bytes_map (ms_writable_byte segs ms) buf cnt = Some w

    ("the kernel may copy [cnt] bytes to [buf]", the copy_to_user /
    EFAULT gate).  [StreamSim.wseg_ok], a decidable predicate over the
    STATIC segment image, settles a buffer in .data/.bss by [vm_compute]
    but says nothing at all about a buffer in memory the process obtained
    from [mmap] or [brk], where the segment image has no bytes and the
    whole grant lives in the overlay.  That is the [DrainAlg.Hread]
    obligation for every arena-based drain loop.

    No new theory is needed, because it is the SAME view: [store_ok] is
    "every byte of this range is defined in [wview]" and
    [read_bytes_map] over [ms_writable_byte] is "every byte of this
    range is defined in [wview]", and both recurse on [a + 1] in
    lockstep.  So the bridge below is an eight-line induction, and it
    hands the buffer obligation the ENTIRE store-side toolbox above:
    [store_ok_zmem] / [store_grant_ok] for a grant, [store_ok_window]
    for .data/.bss, [store_ok_wrap_window] for the stack, and
    [store_ok_mono] / [store_ok_peel] to lift any of them through the
    stores the loop has already performed.  In particular a per-binary
    proof discharges a read buffer with the very tactic it already uses
    for stores, [solve_store_ok].

    Note what is NOT required: no no-wrap side condition.  [store_ok]
    stops before dereferencing the successor of its last byte, exactly
    as [read_bytes_aux] does, so a one-byte buffer at the top of the
    address space is fine on both sides. *)

(** ** The grant case, which is the one that was missing

    A buffer inside an [mmap]/[brk] grant, stated against the
    [store_grant_ok] invariant a loop already carries: the whole grant
    is writable, so every sub-range of it is, so every read INTO it is
    admissible.  The two premises are pure [Z] arithmetic — [lia]-level
    effort at the call site, which is the point. *)
Lemma store_grant_wbuf : forall segs ms (b l buf cnt : word),
  store_grant_ok segs (ms_mem ms) b l ->
  bv_unsigned b <= bv_unsigned buf ->
  bv_unsigned buf + bv_unsigned cnt <= bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l ->
  exists w, read_bytes_map (ms_writable_byte segs ms) buf cnt = Some w.
Proof.
  intros segs ms b l buf cnt Hg Hlo Hhi.
  apply store_ok_wbuf, Hg; rewrite ?of_nat_word_to_nat; lia.

(** The same in [Common/Footprint]'s vocabulary, so a binary that has
    already named its arena [heap_rg base cur] discharges a read buffer
    by exhibiting [covers] — the identical obligation its stores raise,
    and monotone in the bump pointer through [heap_rg_bump]. *)
Lemma heap_rg_wbuf : forall segs ms (b l buf cnt : word) (cur : Z),
  store_grant_ok segs (ms_mem ms) b l ->
  cur <= bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l - bv_unsigned b ->
  covers (heap_rg b cur) buf (word_to_nat cnt) ->
  exists w, read_bytes_map (ms_writable_byte segs ms) buf cnt = Some w.
Proof.
  intros segs ms b l buf cnt cur Hg Hcur Hc.
  destruct Hc as [Hlo Hhi]. cbn [heap_rg rg_lo rg_hi] in Hlo, Hhi.
  rewrite of_nat_word_to_nat in Hhi.
  eapply store_grant_wbuf; [exact Hg | lia | lia].
Qed.

(** A grant straight out of the [mmap]/[brk] step, before any store has
    been layered on: [zmem m b l] is the model's zero-filled overlay
    ([Run.apply_zeros] at one range, [MmapSim.zfill]).  With
    [store_ok_mono]/[store_grant_mono] this is what a loop invariant's
    [store_grant_ok] conjunct is INITIALIZED from. *)
Lemma zmem_wbuf : forall segs ms m (b l buf cnt : word),
  mem_grows (zmem m b l) (ms_mem ms) ->
  bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l <= 2 ^ 64 ->
  bv_unsigned b <= bv_unsigned buf ->
  bv_unsigned buf + bv_unsigned cnt <= bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l ->
  exists w, read_bytes_map (ms_writable_byte segs ms) buf cnt = Some w.
Proof.
  intros segs ms m b l buf cnt Hgr Hnw Hlo Hhi.
  eapply store_grant_wbuf; [ | exact Hlo | exact Hhi ].
  eapply store_grant_mono; [exact Hgr|]. apply store_grant_zmem. exact Hnw.

(** Worked example / regression, in exactly the shape [DrainAlg]'s
    [Hread] hypothesis asks for: a drain loop that has already written
    into its arena still has a writable read buffer there, because the
    stores only GREW the overlay.  Two peels and three [lia]-level
    facts, and — the point — no [vm_compute] anywhere, which is what
    [StreamSim.wseg_ok] could only offer over a static segment. *)
Example drain_buffer_in_grant : forall segs ms m (b l buf cnt : word) a bs,
  ms_mem ms = wbytes (zmem m b l) a bs ->
  bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l <= 2 ^ 64 ->
  bv_unsigned b <= bv_unsigned buf ->
  bv_unsigned buf + bv_unsigned cnt <= bv_unsigned b + bv_unsigned l ->
  exists w, read_bytes_map (ms_writable_byte segs ms) buf cnt = Some w.
Proof.
  intros segs ms m b l buf cnt a bs Hm Hnw Hlo Hhi.
  eapply zmem_wbuf;
    [ rewrite Hm; apply wbytes_grows | exact Hnw | exact Hlo | exact Hhi ].
Qed.

(** ** Dispatch

    The tactic every store site calls.  It peels the overlay
    chain back to something with a known shape and closes the bound
    there; [lia] finishes the address arithmetic. *)

(* [stack_max_size] and [stack_window_reach] have to be unfolded: they

(* [zmem] is NOT part of [store_ok_peel]: a store into the grant is
   discharged AT the [zmem] layer ([store_ok_zmem], in [store_ok_base]),
   so peeling past it would lose the only fact that closes it.  A store
   that is NOT in the grant — a stack slot, with a grant sitting on top
   of the memory — falls through to the second branch, which strips the
   [zmem] and keeps going. *)

(** Loop invariants quantify their memory EXISTENTIALLY ("some [mem]
    agreeing with [fmem] outside the scratch window"), so a stack store
    inside such a loop has no [wrap_mem] to peel back to.  The
    invariant carries [mem_grows wmem mem] instead — the overlay only
    ever grows — and the bound is lifted through it. *)
(* The [mem_grows] fact is usually bundled into the example's memory
   invariant ([bg_ok mem], [mem_ok mem], ...), so the dispatcher cannot
   name it.  Each example registers its own projection here instead. *)
