(** * Common.DivergeSim — reusable trace-semantics infrastructure for a
      SILENTLY DIVERGING branch: execution reaches a machine state from
      which it loops forever without issuing another effectful step.

    TRUST BOUNDARY: image-INDEPENDENT proof library (like Common.ExitSim).
    Generic over the loaded segments [segs].

    WHY THIS EXISTS.  The sealed ASan runtime answers an internal
    allocation failure with a tight infinite loop that makes NO further
    syscalls (typically a single self-jump, [j .] = [jal x0, 0], or an
    equivalent closed loop over a few PCs).  An equivalence proof over
    the spec's failure-anytime mmap nondeterminism must show, at each
    refusal case-split, that the diverging resolution contributes no new
    complete trace and only already-covered prefixes: from the loop
    state, [Run.star] can emit nothing further, so [Run.obs_trace] gains
    only prefixes of the events already emitted (which the prefix
    closure of [bh_traces] contributes anyway), the branch can never
    take the explicit error transition (nothing lands in [bh_errors]),
    and — because the loop is an infinite non-erroring execution — the
    branch also REFUTES [bh_all_errors], so the source-vacuity escape of
    [Equivalence.equiv] cannot fire through it.

    NO COINDUCTION IS NEEDED.  [bh_traces] holds only FINITE prefixes of
    finite [star] derivations, [bh_errors] is a finite reach, and
    [bh_all_errors] is inductive (accessibility), so "loops forever" is
    consumed purely inductively: a set of configurations closed under
    the one deterministic silent step absorbs every finite derivation
    that enters it.  Consequently every lemma here is [Qed] with no
    axioms beyond the baseline.

    STRUCTURE (three layers, from general to executable):

    - [silent_loop P]: a SET of configurations, each un-halted, with no
      pending syscall, whose accounted instruction step ([Run.
      mi_account_step]) succeeds and stays in the set.  This is the
      finite-cycle predicate in its most general, model-threading form
      ([silent_loop_cycle] shows the literal finite-set instance is
      definitional).  Core results: a [star] from a [silent_loop] state
      emits [] ([silent_loop_star]); no error transition is reachable
      ([silent_loop_no_error]); the observation set is exactly {[]}
      ([silent_loop_obs_iff]); and [all_traces_error] is refuted
      ([silent_loop_not_all_errors]).
    - [to_spin ms model]: "this machine state deterministically runs a
      straight line of silent instruction steps into a one-step
      FIXPOINT" — the reach-style predicate an example proof
      establishes at the post-refusal state, mirroring [ExitSim.to_exit]
      (which reaches an exit ecall where this reaches a self-jump).
      The base case is an accounted-step fixpoint; smart constructors
      cover the two ways proofs actually meet it: an instruction with
      an EMPTY access report ([ts_spin_no_access] — any model, lazy
      mappings included, so post-mmap ASan states are covered) and the
      no-lazy raw-step idiom the existing sim files use
      ([ts_spin_no_lazy]/[ts_step_no_lazy] compose with the
      [PropExec.step_*] lemmas over [mkst]).
    - [spin_c]: a fuel-bounded executable witness for [to_spin], closed
      by [vm_compute] on a concrete machine state ([spin_c_to_spin];
      tactic [prove_to_spin]), keyed on recognizing the literal
      self-jump instruction [is_self_jump] (a decoded [Jal rd imm] with
      [rd = x0] and [bv_signed imm = 0] — both the 4-byte [j .] and the
      compressed [c.j .] expand to exactly that).  Use it only when the
      state is concrete enough for the boolean to collapse; symbolic
      proofs chain [ts_step_no_access]/[ts_step_no_lazy] instead.

    HOW A SIM PROOF INVOKES IT.  At an mmap-refusal case-split the
    derivation stands at the post-refusal configuration [mkCfg ms model]
    with some emitted prefix [P] behind it.  Establish
    [to_spin ms model] (by [prove_to_spin], or by chaining
    [ts_step_no_lazy] over [PropExec] step lemmas into
    [ts_spin_of_step_j]); then

    - in the FORWARD direction of a [*_obs_iff] proof, the tail [star]
      of the refusal branch collapses by [spin_star_nil] (so the branch
      trace is [P ++ [] = P], a prefix of the already-covered complete
      trace);
    - in a [*_no_error] proof, the refusal branch's error reach is
      refuted by [spin_no_error_run] (and, at the split configuration
      itself, [spin_no_sstep_error]);
    - the BACKWARD direction needs nothing new: prefixes of [P] are
      already contributed by the derivation that reaches the split
      ([obs_trace_of_star]).

    [spin_branch_toy_*] at the bottom work a complete two-branch toy
    obligation in exactly this shape, and the [SelfJumpImage] section
    checks the executable layer end-to-end on a concrete image whose
    single instruction is the literal [j .] encoding 0x0000006f. *)
