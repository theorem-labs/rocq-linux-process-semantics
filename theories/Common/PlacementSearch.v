(** * Common.PlacementSearch — deciding "is there a free gap here?"

    UNTRUSTED.  Nothing in [EquivalenceDefinition/] or
    [LinuxProcessSem/Sys/] depends on this file; it is proof-library
    machinery, and the trusted spec must not name it.

    [Mmap.mmap_spec] USED TO say three things about a preference-free
    placement — page-aligned, inside the user address space, disjoint
    from every recorded mapping — and leave the choice to the
    nondeterminism monad.  SINCE OSSV-231 IT SAYS WHERE: the fresh-grant
    arms choose with [Mmap.linux_place], which has at most one solution.
    So the three conditions are still NECESSARY ([linux_place_admissible])
    and no longer SUFFICIENT, and a proof that needs one concrete
    address takes it from [Checks.Placement.linux_place_b], not from the
    search here.

    WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR NOW.  Linux's rule answers whenever a range of
    the requested size is free in either of its two windows
    ([Placement.linux_place_exists]).  That is a free-gap question, which
    is exactly what this file decides.  [place_in_model_linux] searches
    the window Linux falls back to, and
    [place_in_model_linux_grants] turns its answer into "the spec has a
    grant", without claiming the searched address is the granted one —
    it is not, in general.

    Both reduce to the same question — does a free gap of [nZ] bytes
    exist in a given interval of the ledger? — and this file answers it
    decidably, with the completeness argument proved.  The trusted spec
    does not use it.

    The candidate argument, which is what makes the question decidable
    at all: if ANY fitting free gap exists in an interval, then one
    exists whose base is either the interval's own floor or the
    page-rounded end of some ledger entry — slide the gap down until it
    rests on one or the other.  So a finite list of candidates suffices,
    one per ledger interval plus one. *)

(** COMPLETENESS of the candidate scan: any page-aligned fitting free
    gap yields a candidate that is free and fitting.  This is the
    sliding argument: take the largest candidate at or below the given
    gap's base; every ledger entry ending at or below the given base has
    its page-rounded end among the candidates (so cannot reach past the
    chosen one), and every entry ending above it starts at or above the
    given gap's end (else it would have overlapped the given free gap).
    So the chosen candidate's window is free, and it inherits both
    bounds. *)

(** THE FLOOR HYPOTHESIS IS [0 <= aZ + nZ], NOT [0 <= aZ], and the

    [aZ] enters this lemma only through [aZ + nZ]: it is the floor of the
    search expressed as a grant's END, and the proof below never needs
    the floor's own sign.  Strengthening it back to [0 <= aZ] costs a
    caller that reduces to this lemma at [aZ := loZ - nZ] the side
    condition [nZ <= loZ], which at a floor of [page_size] silently
    forces [nZ = 4096] — turning a general completeness claim into one
    about single-page requests while still typechecking.  That is how
    [place_complete] below was first written, and it is the reason this
    hypothesis is stated in the form the proof actually uses. *)

(* =========================================================================
   THE PLACEMENT WITNESS — one concrete address, for proofs that want one

   [Mmap.mmap_spec] constrains a preference-free placement by admissibility
   alone and leaves the choice to the nondeterminism monad, which is right
   for the spec and unhelpful for a proof strategy that wants to compute.
   This is the instance that closes that gap: an executable search, a
   soundness lemma against the spec's own conditions, and a completeness
   lemma saying the search finds an address whenever one exists.

   IT IS KERNEL-*LIKE*, NOT KERNEL-PINNED, and the difference is the whole
   reason it lives here rather than in the spec.  Linux's real answer
   depends on the full VMA set, on a per-exec random base, and on a
   process-controlled layout policy; none of that is recoverable from the
   model's ledger, so no function over the ledger is Linux's function.
   What this one is instead is A correct kernel's answer: every address it
   returns is one the spec admits, which is all a witness has to be.

   Determinism IS claimed here, and may be: [find] returns the first
   fitting candidate in the candidate list's order, so [place] is a
   function of its arguments.  That claim is about this function, not
   about any kernel.

    concrete call happens to succeed, which a computation could discharge
    without the search being any good.

    IT IS CONDITIONAL, and the unconditional form is not available.  "The
    admissible set is nonempty" is FALSE for an arbitrary ledger: a full
    one has no gap, which is what [place_finds_nothing_when_full] below
    exhibits.  The honest unconditional statement would be a COUNTING
    argument — the occupied extent plus [nZ] fitting inside the range
    implies a gap exists — and that is not proved here.

    Nobody currently needs it, which is why.  A computational proof
    strategy arrives with a CONCRETE ledger and can exhibit a gap, so

    rest on this file at all, since [Mmap.mmap_spec]'s

(** SOUNDNESS AGAINST THE SPEC'S GUARD, and the conclusion is stated at
    [bv_unsigned (Z_to_bv 64 a)] rather than at [a] ON PURPOSE.

    The guard's conditions are about a [word]: [mmap_spec] quantifies
    over [a : word] and constrains [bv_unsigned a].  This search works in
    [Z], so a conclusion phrased about [a : Z] is the guard's conditions
    TRANSPORTED, not the guard's conditions — they coincide only where
    [bv_unsigned (Z_to_bv 64 a) = a], which needs [0 <= a < 2 ^ 64] and
    does not follow from [place_sound] alone.  Saying "conjunct for
    conjunct" of the [Z] form would overstate by exactly that coercion
    step.

    [0 <= nZ] is what closes it, and every caller has it for free:
    [nZ] is [page_round_up_Z (bv_unsigned len)] at each use site.  The
    round-trip is stated as the first conjunct rather than assumed, so a
    caller gets the bridge along with the conditions.

    Below [0 <= nZ] the search is not wrong, merely unconstrained by this
    lemma — no divergence is reachable, since a negative length makes the
    ceiling test pass on candidates the [region_free] test then rejects —
    but an unreachable gap in a statement is still a gap in the
    statement.

    Still minus the budget, which is the caller's to discharge because it
    depends on the model rather than on the ledger. *)

    [word] without ruling it out, and this is what stops the hypothesis

(* ---- that the completeness lemma is not vacuous ---- *)

(** [place_complete] concludes [exists a, place … = Some a], which cannot
    hold for a reason other than the search returning something — the
    only way it could be hollow is if its HYPOTHESES were unsatisfiable,
    which no reader can see by inspection.  These three instances settle
    that, and they are computations rather than assumptions: the first
    two exhibit ledgers meeting every premise, and the third exhibits one
    that does not, so the function is visibly partial rather than
    trivially total. *)

(** The top a hand-built ledger stands under ([State.mkVmMaps] seeds the
    stack pointer at the bottom of the SP window), so the instances
    below are stated at the same bound every other concrete case in the
    tree uses. *)
Definition demo_top : Z := alloc_top (mkVmMaps [] [] 0 0 0).

(** The search SKIPS an occupied candidate.  [page_size] is a candidate
    and is inside the entry, so the answer is the entry's page-rounded
    end — not the first thing in the list. *)
