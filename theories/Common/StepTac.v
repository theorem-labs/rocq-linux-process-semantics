(** * Common.StepTac — shared step-chaining tactics

    Covers the full set of chain relations ([msteps]/[to_wexit]/[twm]/
    [tmw]/[StreamSim.to_wr]/[StreamSim.to_rd]/[to_exit]/
    [DrainSim.to_out]/[DrainSim.to_rd]).  Each tactic is a SUPERSET of
    the per-example variants: each only fires on a goal whose head
    matches one of its [lazymatch]/[first] arms, and each step is
    pinned down by the caller-supplied fetch/decode lemma ([F]/[D]),
    so extra arms that don't apply just fail over silently.

    Value-normalization note: the canonical computed-value form is
    [Z_to_bv 64 z] with [z] a plain-Z expression.  [sp_norm] therefore
    rewrites nested [v_addi] chains over an abstract in-window sp into
    that form; the [u_Z2bv] helper collapses [bv_unsigned (Z_to_bv 64 z)]
    for the in-range side conditions.

    Shared additions (so examples need no local copies):
    - safe vm layer: [check_closed_term]/[expand_ctx_defs] (is this
      term closed, as the vm sees it?) and [vm_eval] (the guarded
      [eval vm_compute] every value-position vm reduction here uses);
    - closing tactics: [bveq], [vm_refl_bv];
    - closed-redex literal normalizers: [wlit_closed] (argument form)
      and [wlits_closed] (sweep) — replace a CLOSED word redex with its
      vm-computed [Z_to_bv 64 z] literal (the fix for the
      [rewrite v_addi_0_*] fault-address trap);
    - [rdn_ext_lit] — wraps the [erewrite rdn_ext] call-site pattern;
    - shared lemmas: [byte_nz_u], [u_zext8], [zext8_byte],
      [byte_neq_lit_u], [c_eq_zext_lit_false], [u_ntw], [word_add_nat],
      [word_add_nat_0], [word_add_nat_1], [word_add_nat_m1],
      [v_add_comm], [v_add_wrap], [v_sub_0_neg], [u_neg_small],
      [v_addi_neg_S], [bsb_bound], [range_avoids_two].
      (The [x + nat_to_word 0 = x] bridge is named [word_add_nat_0]
      here, NOT [word_add_0_r] — AllocSim exports a different
      [word_add_0_r], stated at [Z_to_bv 64 0].)
    [step_simpl] additionally rewrites [?skipn_O]; [norm_pc] no-ops
    when the machine-state position contains an evar (the
    norm_pc-before-eexists trap) — evar-free invocations are
    unaffected.

    Every vm reduction of a caller-supplied term in this file is
    guarded: value-position reductions go through
    [vm_eval], goal-position closers ([bveq], [stepi_at]'s last
    alternative) through [check_closed_term] — because on an OPEN bv
    term [vm_compute] does not fail, it allocates until the machine
    dies, and [timeout] does not reliably stop it.  See
    [check_closed_term]'s docstring.

    Instruction coverage: [stepi]/[stepi_search]
    dispatch every OpImm / ShiftImm / Op / OpImm32 / ShiftImm32 /
    Op32 / Mul / Mul32 shape with a step lemma ([divu]/[remu] leave
    their divisor-nonzero premise as an extra goal when
    [assumption]/[lia] cannot close it); [stepiv] dispatches the
    [SeqExec.step_*_at] family the same way; [stepw] steps a store of
    any width ([sd]/[sw]/[sh]/[sb]); [stepj] also handles a LINKING
    [jal]; [stepjr] handles [jalr] (ret and register calls).  Smoke
    tests at the end of the file pin one concrete encoding per
    dispatch arm. *)

    reliably stop it (the vm runs as C code that OCaml's signal
    delivery often fails to preempt; measured both ways on the same
    box, same term).  So the term must be proved closed BEFORE the vm
    ever sees it.

    It does not use the stdpp-style [exfalso; clear; pose p] probe,
    which (a) rebuilds the proof state on every call, and (b) fails on
    CLOSED terms whenever an evar in the goal depends on the context
    ([clear] refuses) — the normal state of a chain proof
    mid-[eexists], so that probe cannot guard the per-step paths.

(** One non-branching ALU step inside a chain. Superset of every
    per-example instruction alternation.

    PERFORMANCE: the alternation is DISPATCHED on the decode lemma's
    shape rather than searched.  Every [exact] attempt elaborates its
    whole conclusion — which mentions the full machine state and memory
    image — before it can fail on the [decode_any] premise, so a wrong
    alternative is nearly as expensive as the right one.  Picking the
    single applicable lemma from [type of D] turns up to 14 attempts
    into one (an [Auipc] step, 5th in a searched list, costs ~4 s).
    Shapes not listed here fall through to [stepi_search], so the
    tactic remains a superset of the alternation. *)
(** Coverage note: the dispatch covers every OpImm /
    ShiftImm / Op / OpImm32 / ShiftImm32 / Op32 / Mul / Mul32 shape
    with a step lemma.  The [divu]/[remu] arms are the one exception
    to "closes the step goal": RISC-V defines division by zero, but
    their value shapes ([v_divu]/[v_remu]) do not, so those lemmas
    carry a divisor-nonzero premise.  The arm tries [assumption]/[lia]
    on it and otherwise LEAVES it as an extra goal (ordered before the
    continuation of the chain). *)

    closed redex whose reduction needs conversion on a [bv_signed]
    literal (no pattern variable triggers it), while [replace ... by

    unmapped-address facts) at the same [Z_to_bv 64 z] spelling so
    they apply directly afterwards.  Fails fast when [p] is open

(** ** Avoiding the read-only segments, for any number of segments

    [range_avoids_two] above is fixed at two segments.  Each example
    proves the same fact about its own image, and the hand-rolled proof
    names every segment explicitly — so it has to be edited by hand
    whenever the segment COUNT changes (for example, gcc can give
    .eh_frame a LOAD segment of its own, which takes an image from three
    segments to four).

    [range_avoids_ro_above] states it once, keyed off a single bound:
    if every read-only segment ends at or below [data_base], then any
    range starting at or above [data_base] avoids all of them —
    whatever the segment count.  The premise is closed by [vm_compute]
    on a concrete image, so the per-example lemma becomes one line:

      Lemma source_avoids_ro : forall a n, (0x13000 <= bv_unsigned a)%Z ->
        range_avoids_ro_segs source_segs (bv_unsigned a) n = true.

    Note the range's LENGTH is irrelevant, as it is for
    [range_avoids_ro_two]: a range that starts above every read-only
    segment cannot re-enter one by being long, because the segments lie
    below it. *)
