(** * StartupTac — stepping tactics for the reference startup walk.
    Image-INDEPENDENT (the [F_*]/[D_*] facts are passed as arguments).


    Conventions of these walks:
    - register facts are hypotheses [getr regs r = v]; [pin] rewrites every
      such fact into the goal, so values stay small and symbolic bases
      ([sp0], [d], ...) appear by name;
    - addresses/values relative to a symbolic base [b] are spelled
      [Z_to_bv 64 (bv_unsigned b + k)] / [Z_to_bv 64 (bv_unsigned b - k)];
    - memory is either a plain [wbytes] chain (leaf summaries such as
      [memset]) or [MemSplit.cmem sp0 mem0 J D]. *)
