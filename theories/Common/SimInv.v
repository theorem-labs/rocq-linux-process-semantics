(** * Common.SimInv — generic path-invariant / no-error combinator.

    TRUST BOUNDARY: this file is part of the shared proof library, not the
    trusted specification.  Nothing here knows about any particular
    binary.

    Every "sim" file in [Common/] (ExitSim, CatSim, StreamSim, AllocSim,
    MmapSim, FileSim, DrainSim) closes the [~ reaches_error] obligation the
    same way: it defines a per-file configuration invariant [Inv], proves
    that [Inv] is preserved by every [sstep] to a [SNext] successor, proves
    that [Inv] excludes the [SError] transition, and then lifts these two
    facts along [star] to conclude that no reachable configuration errors.

    The [star]-lifting induction and the final [reaches_error] closure are
    byte-identical across all those files, so they are factored here once:

      - [star_inv]              : [Inv] is preserved along [star]
      - [inv_no_reaches_error]  : [Inv c -> ~ reaches_error segs c]

    Each sim file supplies only its two genuinely per-file hypotheses (the
    step-preservation and no-error lemmas) and instantiates these two
    combinators; its [star_X]/[X_no_error] lemmas become thin corollaries.

    This file is also where the shared ABI-boundary normalization tactics
    live ([norm_fd32], [fd32_ok]): every "sim" file and every per-binary
    proof imports it (directly or through CatSim/StreamSim/FileSim), and
    proof automation shaped by particular example proofs has no business
    sitting in the trusted [LinuxProcessSem.Specs]. *)

(** Proof kit for the per-binary proofs: the fds they step through are

    rewrite needs no side condition.  ([fd32] of a symbolic register is
    left alone; the match simply stops there.) *)

(* =========================================================================
   The [Equivalence.modeled] conjunct, once
   ========================================================================= *)

(** Turn a source [~ reaches_error] proof into the source-coverage
    conjunct of [Equivalence.strong_equiv].  Every combinator below
    ([AllocSim], [AllocSim2], [CatSim], [DrainSim], [ExitSim], [FileSim],
    [MmapSim], [StreamSim]) discharges [modeled] this way — the run never
    errors at all, so a fortiori it never reaches a configuration the
    model declined to interpret ([Run.no_error_no_unmodeled]).  It lives
    here, applied uniformly, so that the ten combinators cannot drift:
    the argument [~ reaches_error] must be about the SOURCE image, pc, sp
    and brk that [run] is applied to, and stating it once makes the
    unifier check that rather than leaving it to a copy-pasted script.

    The combinators whose source is EXPECTED to error need a direct proof
    instead: [ErrEscape.err_escape_modeled] (a deterministic
    [MachineFault]) and [AllocMixSim.tom_no_unmodeled] (a may-faulting
    brk mix). *)
