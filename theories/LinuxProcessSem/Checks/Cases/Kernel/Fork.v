   clone3 (435): THE ARGUMENT BLOCK THAT WALKED OFF THE TOP OF THE
   ADDRESS SPACE

   [Fork.clone3_spec] read its 88-byte [struct clone_args] with
   [State.read_bytes_map] bare, a walk that wraps at 2^64 (see
   [State.copy_bytes_map]'s note), so a [uargs] in the last bytes of the
   address space whose range was backed at both ends was RESOLVED: the
   fields were judged and the call answered with the struct in the
   ledger.  Linux refuses the range before a byte moves:
   [copy_clone_args_from_user] (kernel/fork.c) reads the struct with
   [copy_struct_from_user], whose [copy_from_user] tests [access_ok] in
   [_inline_copy_from_user] (include/linux/uaccess.h).  The arm now asks
   the same through [State.copy_bytes_map] and answers -EFAULT with an
   empty ledger.

   The group is the refusal, the control that the bare walk really would
   have passed — and read a fork-shaped struct — and a neighbour at the
   top of what [State.access_okb] accepts that is still resolved.  The
   memories map exactly their own range.
